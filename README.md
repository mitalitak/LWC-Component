This repo contains implementation of lightning web component.
Click the buttons to activate the onclick handler and view the label of the clicked button.
JavaScript files in Lightning web components are ES6 modules. By default, everything declared in a module is local—it’s scoped to the module.

To import a class, function, or variable declared in a module, use the import statement. To allow other code to use a class, function, or variable declared in a module, use the export statement.
